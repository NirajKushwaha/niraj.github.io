										<h2>Abstract</h2>

									<p>
										Avalanches are a widespread feature of the natural world, describing the eponymous collapse of
snow piles on mountains, mudslides, crackling of Rice Krispies, down to microscopic dislocation
avalanches in sheared materials. Avalanches are also an apt name for cascades on social networks
that spread widely from small groups such as epidemics, memes and behaviors. Not all avalanches,
however, are the same. They propagate through different substrates, network typologies and are
incited by different causes. In theoretical physics, we have a quantitative language for charac-
terizing large-scale differences in terms of symmetries, dimensions and universality classes. Such
characterization derives from renormalization group analysis of idealized avalanche models. Yet,
such mathematical understanding of these models is often distanced from empirical examples of
avalanche phenomena. In this proposal, we would like to bridge this gap by developing a theoreti-
cal extension of forest-fire models in the context of large-scale social phenomena known as conflict
avalanches.<br>
While armed conflict including war is seemingly chaotic, it displays remarkable large-scale regularities. Lee et al. showed that armed conflict features such as number of fatalities, geographic
diameter of conflict spread and conflict duration follow power-law distributions as well as scale
with one another self-consistently. A tantalizing possibility is that simple “physical” scaling
laws emerge because conflict dynamics reflect the same basic properties; e.g. conflict propagates
when sufficient density of excitable geographic sites appears, but then drives itself to extinction by
exhausting local resources. This is only one example of many similar models that might adhere to
the same observed large-scale regularities, so we aim to solve a class of conflict models proposed
from first-principles to distinguish between possible causes.<br>
We will take a two-pronged approach that involves combining measurements from conflict data
and numerical and analytic solutions to potential conflict models. First, we must revisit the question
of how conflicts are defined in the data. It is not trivial to determine how individual “conflict
events,” such as a particular attack or bombing, are related. Instead, individual conflict events first
must be clustered into conflict avalanches. Though a simple distance threshold criterion was used
in previous work—events are related if they are close enough—it was also shown that statistical
regularities depended on length and time thresholds systematically. As is the case in renormalization
of finite systems, relevant parameters can emerge short of the thermodynamic limit such as system
size. The dependence of measured regularities with length scale defines model trajectories under
coarse-graining that will constrain the formulation of the model. With these measurements, we
will consider as a first step extensions of forest-fire models to account for such regularities at the
large scales but also how such regularities are changed as we rescale our unit of analysis. From this
work, we will bridge a major gap in theory of cascade-like phenomena with empirical examples of
conflict including generalizable techniques for inferring nonequilibrium models from data.
